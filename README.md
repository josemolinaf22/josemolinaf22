<h4 align='center'>About Me</h4>
<section align='center'>
<p align='center'>
I began learning how to code when I was just ten years old, not fully understanding its significance. As I progressed through high school, I delved into web development and discovered a strong love for software development.
</p>
<p> 
After graduating high school, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science at Weber State University. However, being a first-generation student without a strong support system, I faced numerous challenges that eventually led me to give up on my education. The need to work two full-time jobs to pay my rent and tuition fees left me with no choice but to return to my hometown, unable to continue my studies at the university.
</p>
<p>
Although I faced setbacks, I never lost my determination to excel in web development. I saved up diligently to attend the challenging boot camp at Devmountain. I balanced screen time with mindful breaks and absorbed the latest practices and techniques. I am aware that my journey has only just begun and I am eager to gain more knowledge and expertise in my chosen field.
