My journey into programming began when I was around 10 years old, long before I even knew what programming truly meant. It was during my high school years that I had the opportunity to delve deeper into web development basics, an experience that ignited a profound love for the world of software development within me.
After graduating from high school, I made the decision to pursue a degree in computer science at Weber State University. However, as a first-generation student without the necessary support systems in place, I faced significant challenges that ultimately led to me having to drop out. The need to work two full-time jobs in order to manage rent and tuition expenses left me with no choice but to return to my hometown, unable to continue my studies at the university.
Despite these setbacks, my determination to learn and grow in the field of web development remained unwavering. I dedicated myself to saving up enough money to attend a bootcamp called Devmountain. The completion of this rigorous course was no easy feat, but with mindful breaks away from the computer screen, I was able to absorb the most up-to-date practices and techniques in development.
I am keenly aware that my learning journey is only just beginning, and I am filled with anticipation as I eagerly pursue further knowledge and expertise in my chosen field.
